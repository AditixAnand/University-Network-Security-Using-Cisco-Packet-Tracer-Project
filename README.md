# University-Network-Security-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Project


## 📌 About
We have developed a **University-Network-Security-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Project** for sending and receiving information among high-security end-users.  
The project demonstrates a **multi-network campus topology** with **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)** and advanced **security configurations** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## 🏫 Project Overview
- Designed a secure **Campus Network topology** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- Implemented **multiple VLANs** for Faculty, Students, Admin, and Guest users.  
- Introduced **critical security features** such as ACLs, DHCP, VPN, and DNS filtering.  
- Incorporated a wide range of **protocols** to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- The network is designed to accommodate both **on-campus and remote users** securely.

## 🔐 Security Features
- **VLAN Segmentation** – to isolate Faculty, Students, Admin, and Guest networks.  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – to restrict inter-VLAN communication.  
- **DHCP Configuration** – for automated IP management.  
- **VPN with MFA** – for secure remote access.  
- **Firewall Rules** – to block malicious or unnecessary traffic.  
- **DNS Filtering** – to enforce smart web access policies.  
- **SIEM Integration** – for centralized monitoring and logging.
